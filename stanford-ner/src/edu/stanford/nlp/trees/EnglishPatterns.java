/** This class contains some English String or Tregex regular expression
 *  patterns. They originated in other classes like
 *  EnglishGrammaticalRelations, but were collected here so that they
 *  could be used without having to load large classes (which we might want
 *  to have parallel versions of.
 *  Some are just stored here as String objects, since they are often used as
 *  sub-patterns inside larger patterns.
